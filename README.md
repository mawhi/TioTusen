## The main goal of the application
How much time does it take to become an expert in something?
10,000 hours of practice. It's a common rule of thumb, popularized by Malcom Gladwell in his bestseller Outliers: The Story of Success.
And even though it is a myth, it could be motivating for some people to track the amount of hours they spend doing something.
This app serves exactly this purpose.

## The main goal of the project (from dev perspective)
My name is Misha and I'm working as an iOS Developer in Stockholm, Sweden. I work for a big project that has a lot of legacy code and there is no chance to try out something shiny new during the work hours. I decided to start this project for this purpose precisely. I will try to use the approaches that I wouldn't choose at my usual work (without being fanatic): SwiftUI, AsyncAwait, etc. 
Consider please that some technologies are not new for you but new for me.

And of course, one of the main goals is to learn. That's why sometimes I will be not rational and will do some things just to try them out. 
However, for documentation purposes I will keep track of all decisions I made and will write what exactly I would do in the real project. 


## What could you do with information used from this repo?

Anything ðŸ˜…

Even though I plan to publish this app to the AppStore (free of charge), I want to create this project as a source of information for developers who want to see how different techs could be used.

The decision logs could be useful for some developers as well who are doing research on tech to use. In my decision logs I will try to consider as much options as possible and write down the best cases where all cases would shine.
I would only ask to mention me everywhere where you use anything from this repo.
